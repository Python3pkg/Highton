Highton-API
===========

#Highton is a python library for Highrise

##What you can do with Highton?

 * You can get nearly all Highrise-data (working on it!)
 * Every data you get from Highton is structured in a simple class - structure (more a the bottom)
 * You have a lot of exception-handler in there so don't worry about to fail
 * Yeah Highton means Highrise and Python - you got it!


##How does the "simple class structure" look like?
You will have the main class so just import Highton to your libraries (will be available on PyPi soon) and call some functions:
```python
import highton

```

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [js-deflate](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) for gzipping of data to make it fit in URLs
